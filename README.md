# How to run 

This code is based on the first web server tutorial in this guide: https://tttapa.github.io/ESP8266/Chap10%20-%20Simple%20Web%20Server.html

1. Upload the code onto the ESP8266 board (I did it via PlatformIO).
2. Go to the root address -- for me, http://esp8266.local did not work, but I was able to hit the server by visiting the IP address itself.
